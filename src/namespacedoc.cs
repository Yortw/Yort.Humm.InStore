	/// Contains types useful for integration with the Humm (formerly Oxipay) API (for payments and refunds).
	/// See <a href="https://docs.shophumm.com.au/pos/getting-started/"/> for a description of the API, it's processes, how to apply for access and so on. Understanding the Humm API will help you to understand how to use this library, even though it is an unoffical C# client and not provided by or associated with Humm.
